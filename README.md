This is a simple Angular project that I created to learn more about the Angular framework. The project consists of a single page application, called first-app, which contains the following components:

A simple homes list component
A homes details page component
A small search filter by city component
A small form for applying component
The homes list and homes details page components are connected to a JSON file in the root directory. This JSON file is watched by the "json server" library, which you can install globally from NPM.

The search filter by city component allows users to filter the homes list by city. The small form for applying component allows users to apply for a home. When a user submits the form, the application prints a message to the console.

The application was first developed using a synchronous approach, where all data was loaded into local variables. The application was then rewritten using an asynchronous approach, where data is loaded on demand.
