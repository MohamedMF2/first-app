# first-app
This is a simple Angular project that I applied to learn and refresh more about the angular framework.

The project consists of a single page application ,first-app, which contains:
a simple Homes list and their details page components with small search filter by city 
and a small form for applying which prints to the console.

at first we applied the app in synchronous approch (local variables) and rewrote in async approch.

the database is a json file in the root directory watched by the "json server" library which you can install globally from NPM.
